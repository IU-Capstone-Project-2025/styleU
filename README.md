docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker system prune -a 
docker-compose up
```

Six containers will be launched in Docker:

- Frontend

## interaction with the interface

To interact with the web application, go to: http://localhost:5173

Two languages are available: **Russian** and **English**
You can switch between them at the bottom of the interface.

Currently, 3 main features are implemented + user registration:
### Color Type Analysis

1. Upload a photo taken in natural lighting

2. Click Analyze

3. Wait a few seconds ‚Äî the app will analyze your color type and generate style recommendations

4. Once the process is complete, you will see:

    Your color type

    Personalized recommendations

üîí If the user is logged in, the data is saved to the database and used later when generating outfits

<u>How it works inside:</u>

1. The frontend sends the photo to the backend

2. The backend sends it to the ML service

3. The ML service returns the color type

4. The backend sends the color type + photo to the LLM service

5. The LLM service generates a prompt and returns color-based style recommendations

6. The backend returns all data to the frontend, which displays it in the interface

## Body Type Analysis

1. Enter your body measurements and select your gender

2. Click Analyze

3. Wait a few seconds ‚Äî your body type will be identified, and style suggestions will be generated

4. Once complete, you'll see your body type and recommendations

üîí If the user is logged in, the data is saved and used in outfit generation

<u>How it works under the hood:</u>

1. The frontend sends the parameters to the backend

2. The backend calculates the body type using a formula

3. The body type and parameters are sent to the LLM

4. The LLM generates a prompt and returns recommendations

5. The backend passes the data to the frontend, which displays it

<u>How it works under the hood:</u>

1. The frontend sends the user request to the backend

2. The user's color type and body parameters are added

3. The data is sent to the Parser

4. The parser creates a prompt to generate the outfit components (e.g., "black silk dress, silver heels")
